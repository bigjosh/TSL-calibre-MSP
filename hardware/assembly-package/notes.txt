1.
No ultrasound cleaning - RTC clock part U2 is sensitive to vibration.

2.
LCD parts are to be hand soldered. The LCD face on the TOP side of the PCB. LCD 
must have clearance above parts below. Use a jig or shim to maintain uniform 1.6mm 
clearance between LCD bottom and PCB top while solderning. Soldering to be done from
the BOTTOM side of PCB. 

3.
LCD part is heat sensitive. Avoid overheating when soldering. Solder alternating
pins to avoid over heating LCD. 

4.
Use the solder reflow profile for RTC clock part U2, included in this directory. 

5.
Parts U1, U2, L1, & L2 are orienation sensitive. See photos in this directory for proper
rotation.

6. See mousebites.png for suggested location mouse bites if required.

7. 
Part C2 is a resistor despite the refdes. The line in the BOM is correct.
