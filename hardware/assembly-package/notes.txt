No ultrasound cleaning - RTC clock part U2 is sensitive to vibration.

2.
LCD parts are to be hand soldered. The LCD face on the TOP side of the PCB. LCD

clearance between LCD bottom and PCB top while solderning. Soldering to be done from
the BOTTOM side of PCB. 

3.
LCD part is heat sensitive. Avoid overheating when soldering. Solder alternating
pins to avoid over heating LCD.
