# PROGRAMMING

## Set up

### Software
 1. Download `program.py` and `tsl-calibre-msp.txt` from a release in this repo.
 2. Install Python. (The TSL programming script is in Python)
 3. Install [KeyRing](https://pypi.org/project/keyring/). (We use KeyRing to securely store the AirTable API key)
 4. Install [MSPFlasher](https://www.ti.com/tool/MSP430-FLASHER). (This actually talks to the programming hardware)
 5. Make sure that the MSPFlasher executable is in the search path.
 6. Create and copy a new AirTable access token [here](https://airtable.com/create/tokens). Give it a good name like "TSL programming station" and "data.records:write" access scope to the TSL database.
 7. Add the above token to KeyRing by entering this command...
     `keyring set "tsl-airtable" "token"`
      ...and then pasting in the token you got in the step above when prompted for the "password". You have to press enter after 
     you paste it. Note that it does not print the token to the screen when you paste it.  
 
### Hardware
1. Get yourself a TI board with an EZFet programmer on it. There are lots and any will do. I used the MSP-EXP430FR4133.
2. Remove all of the jumpers on the programmer board and connect it to the computer via USB.
3. Connect the pins from the EZFet side of the programmer (the side closer to the USB) to the programming connector like this...
    | Programmer pin | TSL pin |
    | - | - | 
    | G | G |
    | 3V3 | V |
    | SBWTDIO | R | 
    | SBWTICK | T |

## Commissioning Procedure
1. Connect a new TSL board without batteries to the programming connector.
2. Run the `program.py` program and make sure it completes without error.
3. Confirm that the TSL starts, the two LEDs flash, and the display shows the 'First Start' message.
4. Disconnect the programming connector. The display should fade out. 
5. Within 1 minute, install the batteries into the TSL.
6. Confirm that it displays the 'Load Pin' message.
7. Assemble the TSL into the tube.
8. Insert the trigger pin and confirm that the display says 'Arming' followed by the dancing dashes animation.
9. Confirm that the dancing dashes display lights all the LCD segments and that it steps with a steady 1Hz cadence.
10. Pack it up and ship it out! 

## Troubleshooting

Try unplugging the EZFET board from the USB and plugging it back in. Sometimes it gets messed up if the computer goes to sleep.
